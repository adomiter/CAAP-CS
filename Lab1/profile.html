        <h2> About Me </h2>
        
        <p> Coffee is not only a cafe, but an organization dedicated towards not only the advancement of sustainibility, but offering the world a new and affordable experience with coffee. In 2018, "Coffee" was initially created to help sleep-deprived students get through their classes. However, it has become so much more than that and we hope that you join us in this experience. </p>

            <p>I have been a barista for 10 years and am proud to say that all my baristas are highly trained to fulfill all of our coffee needs. It took 5 years to plan out and look for the best coffee the world has to offer. I've traveled far and wide to gain a greater understanding of coffee. Now, I have created this business to share my findings. </p>
